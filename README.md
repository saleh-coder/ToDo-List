# 📝 To-Do List
A simple to-do list application to manage tasks, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. The tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage so they persist even after the page is reloaded.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Add tasks**: Easily add tasks to your to-do list.
- 🗑️ **Delete tasks**: Remove tasks from the list with a click of a button.
- ✔️ **Mark tasks as completed**: Click on a task to mark it as completed.
- 💾 **Save tasks**: Tasks are saved in the browser’s localStorage so they are persistent across page reloads.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout for the application.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. Also, stores tasks in localStorage.
